    <br> Getting to know Cadenza:
    <br>
    <br> In order to begin creating your masterpiece, you'll need to become familiar with some how Cadenza creates music.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br> Powered by the VexFlow music notation language, Cadenze takes input from users that is written in VexTab. Below are some of the key commands you'll need to get started:
    <br>
    <br> "stave" - Generate a new staff, and you can create as many of these as you'd like.
    <br>
    <br> "tabstave" - Generate a tabstave (double staff); typically used for guitar compositions.
    <br>
    <br> "voice" - Creates a staff for voice compositions.
    <br>
    <br> "notation" - Set this equal to true AFTER you've created however many staffs using the above commands.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br> Creating notes:
    <br>
    <br> Creating notes in Cadenza is a very simple process. Use the following command format as an example:
    <br>
    <br> notes D-E-G/4
    <br>
    <br> To add sharps, naturals, and flats to your composition, the previous command can be modified into the following:
    <br>
    <br> notes D#-En-G@/4
    <br>
    <br> To add rests, insert two hashes (##) after the set of notes you've created. For example:
    <br>
    <br> notes D-E-F/4 ##
    <br>
    <br>
    <br> Expanding your compositions:
    <br>
    <br> To create a new measure in your composition, insert " | " after the first set of notes you've created. For example:
    <br>
    <br> notes D-E-F-G/4 | D-E-F/4 ##
    <br>
    <br>
    <br> A list of other useful commands to know to fully utilize Cadenza:
    <br>
    <br> "clef" - Set equal to treble, bass, alto, tenor, etc.
    <br>
    <br> "tablature" - Set equal to true, or don't declare at all if you'd like the tabstave to be present beneath your notation stave, and false if you wish to remove it.
    <br>
    <br> :8 - Place before your string of notes to create eighth notes. See the following for an example:
    <br>
    <br> notes :8 D-E-F/4
    <br>
    <br> :16 - Place before your string of notes to create sixteenth notes.
    <br>
    <br> :32 - Place before your string of notes to create thirty-second notes.
